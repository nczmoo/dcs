SUMMARY
    Dungeon Crawler Slots 
        You crawl a dungeon to get gold but you have to use a slot machine to get better equipment to go deeper.

TODO
    Dungeon
        Start crawling
        Mobs spawn as you go forward and you fight them.
        Mobs get progressively more difficult.
        You can retreat back to the entrance, fighting progressively easier monsters on your way out.
        When you get back to the entrance, you leave the dungeon.
        Health replenishes when exiting dungeon.

QUESTIONS
    What can you get from the slots?
        Potions
        Upgrades to armor and weapons (making it as generic as possible for the prototype)

    What symbols are on the reel?
        Heal potion
        Weapon
        Armor
        Health Upgrade        
        (maybe put the rest blank cause I can't think of anything else)

    What should happen when you die in the dungeon?

    Should the player be able to craft their own reels?

DESIGN
    Reels spin for six seconds but can be skipped.

    Dungeon
        It's an autobattle situation. Just do rats for now, which get progressively more powerful as you progress forward.
        Mobs drop random gold (0, power)
MAYBE
    make armor degrade so it has to be repaired
