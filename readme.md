SUMMARY
    Dungeon Crawler Slots 
        You crawl a dungeon to get gold but you have to use a slot machine to get better equipment to go deeper.

    Slots

QUESTIONS
    What can you get from the slots?
        Potions
        Upgrades to armor and weapons (making it as generic as possible for the prototype)

    What symbols are on the reel?
        Heal potion
        Weapon
        Armor
        Health Upgrade
        Power Upgrade
        (maybe put the rest blank cause I can't think of anything else)

    What should happen when you die in the dungeon?

DESIGN
    Reels spin for six seconds but can be skipped.

    Dungeon
        It's an autobattle situation. Just do rats for now, which get progressively more powerful as you progress forward.
        Mobs drop random gold (0, power)
MAYBE
